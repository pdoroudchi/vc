# Welcome to my Version Control Practice Repo!

Here is what I did for this small project:

1. Clone the VC repo https://github.com/DataGlacier/VC.git (git clone https://github.com/DataGlacier/VC.git)
2. Create new branch in local repository (git branch new_branch)
3. Checkout newly created branch (git checkout new_branch)
4. Run add.py script and add name and favorite sport as input (python add.py)
5. Run test script (pytest test/test.py -s)
6. Add (git add add.py), commit (git commit -m "Add name and favorite sport as input"), merge (git checkout main -> git merge new_branch -> git branch -d new_branch) and push changes to vc remote repo (git remote set-url origin https://github.com/pdoroudchi/vc.git) -> git push --force --setupstream origin main)
